# Welcome to the CWD Coding Challenge!

After cloning make sure to run `npm install` and then `npm start` to install the dependencies and to laungh the server.

The Dependencies this package contains other than the defaults are
* "node-sass": "^4.14.1"
* "react-router-dom": "^5.2.0"

The first is to use Sass/Scss instead of CSS, but you can also install your own dependency to use a styling library such as Semantic, Bulma, Bootstrap, etc...

The second is to use react-router for the Nav Bar. If you prefer an alternative, that is fine as well.

The purpose of this Code Challenge isn't simply to test you on your abilities but also to show you the structure and hygiene we prefer and expect from our developers within our projects so that we don't have multiple different structures for each project.
